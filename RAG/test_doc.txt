This is a sample text document for testing the upload functionality.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test the document chunking and indexing process.

The RAG Demo application should be able to process this file and add it to the search index.

This document can be used to verify that:
1. File upload works correctly
2. Text content is properly extracted
3. Documents are chunked appropriately
4. Content is indexed in Azure Search
5. The uploaded content can be found through search queries

Testing various content types and structures helps ensure the system works reliably.
